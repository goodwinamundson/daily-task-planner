# Daily Task Planner

## Description
The purpose of this project was to create a scheduling application using HTML CSS and JavaScript that shows normal working hours as time color-coded time slots and allows the user to save tasks in each time slot which are saved even if the page is refreshed.

The acceptance criteria for this project are:

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule

WHEN I open the planner

THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

WHEN I scroll down

THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours

WHEN I view the time blocks for that day

THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

WHEN I click into a time block

THEN I can enter an event

WHEN I click the save button for that time block

THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

WHEN I refresh the page

THEN the saved events persist
